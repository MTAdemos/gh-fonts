This comprises four hand-written PostScript fonts for music. With the
Music Fonts

With the exception of Breath-02.ps, these all take a base font and alter it:
the alterations are substantial, but this does provide a sensible set
of defaults.

They are all Type 3 fonts, which is the form for hand coding rather 
than using the Type1 encoded method as what is here would make little 
use of the Type1 machinery.

They comprise:

Breath-02.ps
============
A font for plainsong. The basic primitive for the noteheads is a 
square, and a delicacy for modern versions of plainsong notation is 
that the ratio of the height of that square to the separation of the 
staff lines varies. Various basic values can be altered for the 
relative sizes of the noteheads, of which  NeumeWidth is the most 
fundamental. In this it is set to 250, where the staff line period 
is 400.

Byrd05.ps
=========
A font emulating the work of the last of the British music engravers, 
cut originally to do the volumes of the Complete Works of William Byrd 
which were unfinished at his death.


Dunstab04.ps
============
Something using diamond noteheads, based on 14th century English 
notation

Walsh01.ps
==========
Created for the BBC reconstruction of the first performance of 
Handel's Water Music, this is a handwriting font, emulating the work 
of one of Handel's copyists, which includes random variations in the 
exact shapes of symbols to reflect the variations in this copyist's 
work.
